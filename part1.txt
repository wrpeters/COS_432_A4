COS 432 Assignment 4: Network Security
Part 1: Exploring Network Traces

================================================================================

1. There are no more than five devices actively communicating on the local area network. What are their MAC and IP addresses? Who manufactured these devices?

Device 1 
IP Address: 10.0.2.231
MAC Address: 00:1f:c6:8f:29:17
Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer, Inc.

Device 2
IP Address: 10.0.2.191
MAC Address: 00:1e:8c:ea:1a:b4
Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer, Inc.

Device 3
IP Address: 23.63.194.110
MAC Address: a4:2b:8c:f6:eb:81
Manufacturer: Netgear

Device 4
IP Address: None
MAC Address: 00:12:17:31:10:7c
Manufacturer: Cisco

Device 5
IP Address: 67.194.192.1
MAC Address: 00:1f:6d:e8:18:00
Manufacturer: Cisco

================================================================================

2. What type of network does this appear to be (e.g., a large corporation, an ISP back- bone, etc.)? Point to evidence from the trace that supports this.

Based on DNS traffic to websites like Dropbox, NY Times, Facebook, Twitter, USA Today, LinkedIn etc it seems like this is a personal home network for a particular user. This user is clearly using the network for personal/leisure activities. This is opposed to a more corporate network which would have more work related websites being visited which is not the case for this packet capture.

================================================================================

3. One of the clients connects to an FTP server during the trace.

a. What is the DNS hostname of the server it connects to?

ftp.mirror.nl

b. Is the connection using Active or Passive FTP?

Active FTP

c. Based on the packet capture, what is one major vulnerability of the FTP protocol?

A packet capture on the FTP protocol allows for a user's username and password to be easily observed. For example, this user attempted to login with
username "laticia.langhans" and password "goblue3859".

d. Name at least two network protocols that can be used in place of FTP to provide secure file transfer. Use the associated acronyms.

Alternatives include File Transfer Protocol with SSL/TLS (or FTPS) or SSH File Transfer Protocol (or SFTP).

================================================================================

4. The trace shows that at least one of the clients makes HTTPS connections to sites other than Facebook. Pick one of these connections and answer the following:

a. What is the domain name of the site the client is connecting to?

clients4.google.com

b. Is there any way the HTTPS server can protect against the leak of information in (a)? If yes, explain why. If no, explain why not.

The client must know the name of the server it is connecting to. This information can therefore not be hidden and as a result cannot be prevented from
being leaked. Even if it was encrypted, an attacker could use a timing attack to see what DNS protocol packets were sent around the target HTTPS connection.

c. During the TLS handshake, the client provides a list of supported cipher suites. List the first three cipher suites and name the cryptographic algorithms used in each.

TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc00a):
- Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
- Advanced Encryption Standard with 256bit key in Cipher Block Chaining (AES 256 CBC)
- Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA)

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014):
- Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)
- Rivest Shamir Adleman algorithm (RSA)
- Advanced Encryption Standard with 256bit key in Cipher Block Chaining (AES 256 CBC)
- Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA)

TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA (0x0088):
- Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE)
- Rivest Shamir Adleman algorithm (RSA)
- CAMELLIA with 256bit key in Cipher Block Chaining mode (CAMELLIA 256 CBC)
- Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA)

d. Are any of these cipher suites worrisome from a security or privacy perspective? Why?

RSA may be slightly concerning under some use cases as implementations with keys longer than 3072 bits have shown to have heavy performance issues
which can lead to connection timeouts and even full service unavailability in the worst case.

CBC is concerning as researchers have shown TLS with CBC to be vulnerable to many timing attacks and CBC is also vulnerable to plain-text attacks 
when used with certain older versions of TLS/SSL.

The SHA has also been proven to be insecure since 2017.

e. What cipher suite does the server choose for the connection?

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (0xc011)

================================================================================

5. One of the clients makes a number of requests to Facebook.

a. Even though logins are processed over HTTPS, what is insecure about the way the browser is authenticated to Facebook?

One insecure way the browser is authenticated to Facebook is through cookies which are easily observable on Wireshark if a packet capture is obtained. For
example, when the user visits the Facebook homepage a lot of sensitive information is available to see via cookies such as the c_user cookie which relates to the user's user_id.

b. How would this let an attacker impersonate the user on Facebook?

An attacker could copy and paste this cookie information when making a request to go to Facebook and get logged into the user's account.

c. How can users protect themselves against this type of attack?

A user can protect themselves from this type of attack by sacrificing convenience and either blocking cookies or clearing them regularly. Another option is to encrypt the cookies and keep them from being exposed through plaintext. This can be done by using something like SSL to encrpyt the cookie information.

d. What did the user do while on the Facebook site?

It seems like the user started off by browsing the homepage and looking at a few articles and even liking a post. They also seem to have explored their recommendations. Finally, they seem to have explored some profile pages and even used a bit of messaging as well.
