COS 432 Assignment 4: Network Security
Part 1: Exploring Network Traces

================================================================================

1. There are no more than five devices actively communicating on the local area network. What are their MAC and IP addresses? Who manufactured these devices?

Device 1 
IP Address: 10.0.2.231
MAC Address: 00:1f:c6:8f:29:17
Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer, Inc.

Device 2
IP Address: 10.0.2.191
MAC Address: 00:1e:8c:ea:1a:b4
Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer, Inc.

Device 3
IP Address: 192.168.1.1
MAC Address: a4:2b:8c:f6:eb:81
Manufacturer: Netgear

Device 4
IP Address: None
MAC Address: 00:12:17:31:10:7c
Manufacturer: Cisco

Device 5
IP Address: 67.194.192.222
MAC Address: 00:1f:6d:e8:18:00
Manufacturer: Cisco


- one device will not have ip addresses (ARP)
- one device device will be private (ARP)
- mac address format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX


================================================================================

2. What type of network does this appear to be (e.g., a large corporation, an ISP back- bone, etc.)? Point to evidence from the trace that supports this.


================================================================================

3. One of the clients connects to an FTP server during the trace.

a. What is the DNS hostname of the server it connects to?


b. Is the connection using Active or Passive FTP?

- google active vs passive


c. Based on the packet capture, what is one major vulnerability of the FTP protocol?


d. Name at least two network protocols that can be used in place of FTP to provide secure file transfer. Use the associated acronyms.


================================================================================

4. The trace shows that at least one of the clients makes HTTPS connections to sites other than Facebook. Pick one of these connections and answer the following:

a. What is the domain name of the site the client is connecting to?

- Filter by http connections


b. Is there any way the HTTPS server can protect against the leak of information in (a)? If yes, explain why. If no, explain why not.


c. During the TLS handshake, the client provides a list of supported cipher suites. List the first three cipher suites and name the cryptographic algorithms used in each.


d. Are any of these cipher suites worrisome from a security or privacy perspective? Why?


e. What cipher suite does the server choose for the connection?


================================================================================

5. One of the clients makes a number of requests to Facebook.

- Might have something to do with cookies


a. Even though logins are processed over HTTPS, what is insecure about the way the browser is authenticated to Facebook?


b. How would this let an attacker impersonate the user on Facebook?


c. How can users protect themselves against this type of attack?


d. What did the user do while on the Facebook site?
